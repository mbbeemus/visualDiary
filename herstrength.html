        <p class="pink-paragraph">
            HerStrength is a menstrual cycle tracking app synced with a woman’s exercising
routine to promote healthy workouts that align with each phase
of a woman’s cycle. This app takes into account a woman’s menstrual cycle,
noting what days she is in her luteal phase, menstruation, etc. Concurrently,
the app pulls in data about women’s health to provide suggestions for
workout routines. For example, in the follicular phase is a time of great energy
where women’ s strength is usually at an all time high. At this point,
she should focus on muscle building and weight lifting. On the other hand,
during the luteal phase, a woman should focus on rest and lower-intensity
to prepare her body for menstruation. HerStrength’s goal is to promote
women’s health for a lifestyle filled with strength and confidence.

		<h3 class="project-heading">Research</h3>
        <p class="pink-paragraph">The intended demographic of this app are younger women ranging from the
            ages of 18-29. These women likely promote a healthy lifestyle for themselves
            or are looking to begin a more-healthy approach to living. These women are
            often very busy and may not have the time to complete their own research
            about their cycles. The process of logging data cannot be exhaustive. In order
            to ensure these women stay consistent on the app, logging their workouts
            should be an optional feature and not complex if they do decide to use
            it.</p>

            <div class="col-md-6">
                <p class="pink-paragraph"><strong>Hormone Fluctuations</strong></p>
                <ul class="pink-paragraph">
                    <li>A lot of these women are likely frustrated with the fluctuation
                        of hormones throughout the cycle which may cause
                        inconsistencies in the gym.</li>
                    <li>These fluctuations can be very frustrating and discouraging.</li>
                    <li>Women may feel like they are not improving or even falling
                        behind but instead, their strength and energy is actually
                        linked with their cycle.</li>

                <ul class="pink-paragraph">
                    <li>Many workout apps are focused on the male physique and
                        do not take into account the varying energy/hormone levels
                        for women throughout the month.</li>
                    <li>Many women are told, “rest more” or “exercise more” to
                        help with their health- but never really told why.</li>
                    <li>Workout apps do not give guidelines to women to optimize
                        on the menstrual cycle.</li>
                    <li>Many cycle tracking apps do not integrate physical health
                        but instead, focus on mental health/mood.</li>

        <p class="pink-paragraph">
            This project significantly expanded my design and programming skillset,
pushing me to new limits. It was not without its challenges, however.
I frequently encountered frustration with Repplit’s inconsistent
execution of design choices and lack of specific functionality, which
often led to application-breaking errors after repeated re-prompts.
Despite these roadblocks, the experience was highly insightful. It highlighted
key areas for growth in “vibe coding”, inspiring me to further
develop this project. My next steps include strengthening my skills to
implement improved functionality, integrate LLMs, and refine data
insights. I also plan to introduce new features such as workout plans,
performance comparisons, and strength charting. Overall, this project
was a valuable and formative experience for my future technical development.
